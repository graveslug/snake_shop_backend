### Dependicies 
Bcyrpt - it hashes our passwords so no one can see the plain text of a users password.
Mongoose - allows us to connect to the mongoDatabase where we are pulling(fetching or data)
cors - allows our application to run at one origin to transfer data between browser and servers. 
express - allows us to do certain things that may take more time if just using Node.js 
dotenv - allows us to access the .env file where our secrets lie. 
jwt-simple - encode and decode module for node.js.
morgan - logs any request made automatically 
parser - converts an HTML string to one or more REACT elements.
passport - used to authenticate requests. 
passport-jwt - uses a authenticating with JSON web token 
nodemon - allows use to make changes to our application without having to refresh our web browser. 

### Techonolgies 
The different technologies used inside of this code were NODE.js, Express.js, and Mongooose. We are using a models folder which is holding our schema. Also authecation to allow a user to  login/logout/and signup for a web application. 

### Approach Taken 

Our appraoch was very simple we wanted to create a backend that handled our schemas and controllers. Eventually we wanted to connect those to our mongoDB. We also wanted to tackle authecation at first trying to to use Redux however, decided to go a simplier route use a config folder with a config.js and passport.js.
