### Techonolgies 
The different technologies used inside of this code were NODE.js, Express.js, and Mongooose. We are using a models folder which is holding our schema. Also authecation to allow a user to  login/logout/and signup for a web application. 

### Approach Taken 

Our appraoch was very simple we wanted to create a backend that handled our schemas and controllers. Eventually we wanted to connect those to our mongoDB. We also wanted to tackle authecation at first trying to to use Redux however, decided to go a simplier route use a config folder with a config.js and passport.js. 


### Unsolved Problems

Connecting our snake schema to the mongoDB. 

Finishing the CSS.
